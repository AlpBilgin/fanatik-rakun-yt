# FanatikRakun Youtube Forwarding Project

Once upon a time, before facebook decided to be a video platform, youtube video previews on facebook had oversized cards to facilitate content sharing.

After fb decided to be a video platform, yt previews shrunk in size. I came up with this very thin wrapper to subvert the fb blacklist on yt links by embedding yt content on a 3rd party URL.

We managed to serve videos from Fanaticraccoon channel for a while before fb banned the tool.
